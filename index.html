        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Like many of you, I'm hoping to break into the world of web development. This course is one of many steps to get there, and I hope to make the most out of my tiem here!</p>
        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I am from The Valley, or South Texas, but I've moved many times growing up.</p>
        <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <p>Writing, singing, and listening to music our my favorite hobbies, but every now and then I try to be active as well. I'm big on football and mma, and I am looking to start training in mma again once I am done with this bootcamp.</p>
        <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>My dream job would be professional world traveler/blogger, but for now I'll settle for Web Developer! Just kidding, but realistically I would love to do anything that fullfils my creative itch.</p>
        <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>Austin, TX</p>
        <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>I'm looking to persue a fullfiling career in a rapidly growing field that I've heard nothing but amazing things about. My experience talking to people in the field has always given me a more than stellar view on what to look forward to.</p>
